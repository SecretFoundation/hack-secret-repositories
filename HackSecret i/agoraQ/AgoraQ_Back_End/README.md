Running a local version of the webpage requires http-server. Run “npm install --global http-server” if you do not already have it.

Ensure that localsecretv1.8 is running in a docker container with the following ports: 9091 26657 1317 5000

Then run the python script in the same directory containing the AgoraQ Back End and Front End folders.

In a browser, proceed to the location that http-server is running in. Likely “localhost:8080”.
